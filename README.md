# FinanceBank React Native Front-end

This is a React Native financial management app for viewing transactions and statements, with support for filtering by period and transaction type.

## Description

The statement screen in this React Native app offers a visual representation of the user's financial transactions. It uses components such as FlatList or ScrollView to display a list of transactions, where each list item contains information such as date, description, value, and transaction type.

Additionally, to make the statement screen more visually appealing, it presents colors and icons to differentiate debit and credit transactions, and uses components such as Card to display each transaction in a more organized way.

An interesting feature is the ability to filter transactions by time period or type, implemented with components such as Picker or DatePicker.
